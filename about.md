I'm a life long hacker with a nack for [offensive security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test).  I'm currently employed at [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/), the makers of [FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), where I'm focused on security testing, the [bug bounty program](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/bug-bounty/faq-webapp/), and product/project security advocacy.

I started using open source software in the 90's as a Linux user and at the time the idea of being able to use and modify freely available software just about blew my mind. Over the years, I've come to use open source software more and more in my profession and it has become a central focus of my career.

I consider myself an aggressive problem solver. I like to work on really hard problems with other talented people who want to do the same.
