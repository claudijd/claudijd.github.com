I'm a life long hacker with a nack for offensive security. I've held security-focused roles as pentester, consultant, manager, and vulnerability researcher with leading organizations. During that time, I've been fortunate enough to work and collaborate with some of the best minds in the information security industry, which inspired me to share my own research at leading security conferences such as THOTCON, SOURCE, DEFCON, and BlackHat.

I'm also a big FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) advocate. I started using open source software in the 90's as a Linux user and at the time the idea of being able to use and modify freely available software just about blew my mind. Over the years, I've come to use open source software more and more in my profession and it has become a central focus of my career.

Lastly, I consider myself an aggressive problem solver. In other words, I like to spend my time on solving really hard problems and working with other talented people who want to do the same.
